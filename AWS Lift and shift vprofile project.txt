Let’s break down your “Lift and Shift Application Workload on AWS” project step by step, starting from the very basics, so you understand the whole picture clearly. I’ll also explain all the AWS concepts and how they tie together.

1️⃣ Project Overview

Project Name: Lift and Shift Application Workload

Goal: Move (lift) an existing multi-tier application (vProfile) from local machines (or virtual machines using Vagrant) to AWS cloud (shift).

Why: To reduce infrastructure complexity, cost, and improve scalability and automation.

Lift and Shift basically means you are not changing the application design; you are moving it “as is” to the cloud.

2️⃣ Problem with On-Premise Setup

On your local data center:

Multiple servers run different services (Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache, DNS, etc.).

Managing all these requires multiple teams:

Virtualization team

Sysadmin team

Monitoring team

Operations team

Scaling up or down is manual, costly, and time-consuming.

Infrastructure is static and inflexible.

High upfront cost for hardware procurement and maintenance.

Manual operations increase human errors.

Solution: Move to cloud computing (AWS), which offers:

Pay-as-you-go model (like electricity) → no upfront hardware cost.

Elastic scaling → resources automatically adjust to load.

Automation → Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and reduced human error.

Easier management and modernized infrastructure.

3️⃣ AWS Services Used

Here’s what each service does in this project:

Service	Purpose
EC2	Virtual machines to run application and backend services (Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache).
Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)	Distributes incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances for high availability and performance.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG)	Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on load, saving cost and maintaining performance.
S3	Cloud storage to store artifacts (built application code) and static files.
Route 53	DNS service to map application names to IP addresses, including private IPs for backend servers.
Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)	Manages SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS encryption for your website.
Security Groups	Firewall rules to allow or block traffic to instances.
EBS	Storage attached to EC2 for databases and file storage.
Optional: EFS	Shared storage across multiple EC2 instances if needed.
4️⃣ Previous Project vs AWS

Previously, the app ran on Vagrant virtual machines on your laptop:

Tomcat → Application server

MySQL → Database

Memcache → Caching

RabbitMQ → Message queue

Nginx/Apache → Web server

Now, the same stack is migrated to AWS with these benefits:

Public access via HTTPS through ALB

Auto-scaling of Tomcat servers

Backend servers in private network (not directly accessible from the internet)

DNS management with Route 53

Centralized storage with S3

Security managed with Security Groups and IAM roles

5️⃣ Architecture

Here’s a step-by-step architecture explanation:

User Access:

Users access the app via a URL (hosted on GoDaddy or any DNS provider).

DNS points the URL to the Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Load Balancer (ALB):

Receives HTTPS requests from users.

SSL certificate provided by ACM.

ALB is in a security group allowing only HTTPS traffic.

Application Layer (Tomcat EC2 Instances):

ALB forwards requests to Tomcat servers.

Tomcat instances are in a separate security group allowing traffic only from ALB on port 8080.

These instances are managed by an Auto Scaling Group, so the number of servers adjusts automatically based on traffic.

Backend Services:

MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Memcache run on separate EC2 instances.

Each backend instance has its own security group.

Tomcat communicates with backend instances using private DNS entries in Route 53.

Storage & Artifacts:

Application artifacts (like WAR files for Tomcat) are stored in S3.

EC2 instances download these artifacts to deploy the app.

6️⃣ Execution Flow

Log in to AWS console.

Create key pairs for EC2 login.

Create security groups for:

Load balancer

Tomcat servers

Backend servers

Launch EC2 instances using user data scripts (bash scripts to install software).

Update Route 53 private DNS with backend server IPs.

Build the application from source locally and upload it to S3.

EC2 Tomcat instances download artifacts from S3 and deploy.

Set up Application Load Balancer with HTTPS.

Map domain name to ALB endpoint.

Test application.

Configure Auto Scaling Group for Tomcat to handle traffic automatically.

7️⃣ Key Objectives

Flexible Infrastructure → Add/remove instances based on traffic.

Cost-Effective → Pay-as-you-go, no upfront hardware cost.

Modernized Application → Cloud-native features like ALB, S3, Auto Scaling.

Automation → Infrastructure as Code to reduce manual intervention.

Security → Isolated network with security groups and private DNS.

✅ Summary

You are taking an on-prem multi-tier application and migrating it as-is to AWS (Lift and Shift).

You will use EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, S3, Route 53, ACM, and Security Groups.

The end goal is a highly available, secure, and scalable production setup with minimal manual effort.

Yes, absolutely.

You can definitely use Amazon Route 53 (Amazon's DNS service) instead of GoDaddy for the public-facing part of your website. In fact, for a project hosted entirely on AWS, it's often the recommended and more efficient approach.

How Amazon Route 53 Replaces GoDaddy
It's helpful to understand that services like GoDaddy and Route 53 can perform two distinct roles:

Domain Registrar: The service where you purchase and renew your domain name (e.g., my-vprofile-app.com).

DNS Hosting: The service that holds your domain's records and tells browsers where to find your website (e.g., pointing my-vprofile-app.com to your AWS Load Balancer's IP address).

Amazon Route 53 can perform both of these roles. Here are the two common ways you would use it to replace GoDaddy:

Option 1: Use Route 53 for DNS Hosting Only
If you've already bought your domain at GoDaddy, you can keep it registered there but let Route 53 manage the traffic.

You create a "Public Hosted Zone" in Amazon Route 53 for your domain.

Route 53 gives you a set of 4-6 unique name servers (e.g., ns-123.awsdns-01.com).

In your GoDaddy account, you change the name servers from GoDaddy's defaults to the ones provided by Route 53.

From that point on, Route 53 is in control of directing your users to your AWS resources.

Option 2: Use Route 53 as Both Registrar and DNS Host
This is the most integrated approach. You can either transfer your existing domain from GoDaddy to Route 53 or purchase a new one directly from Amazon.

When your domain is managed by Route 53, it automatically creates a Public Hosted Zone for you.

All your domain management, renewal, and DNS record configuration happens in one place: the AWS Management Console.

Key Benefits of Using Route 53 for an AWS Project
Seamless Integration: Route 53 is tightly integrated with other AWS services. For example, when you create an Application Load Balancer (ALB), you can easily point your domain to it using an "Alias" record in Route 53, which is simpler and more efficient than using an IP address.


Consolidated Management: Your domain registration, billing, and DNS configuration are all handled within your AWS account, simplifying administration.

Performance and Reliability: Route 53 is a globally distributed DNS service, designed for high availability and low latency, which means it can resolve DNS queries for your users very quickly, no matter where they are.

Advanced Features: It offers advanced routing policies (e.g., routing users based on their geographic location or the health of your servers) that go beyond the basic DNS services offered by many registrars.
